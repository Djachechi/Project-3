![Baldhead Home Sample](https://github.com/Djachechi/Project-3/blob/main/APP/Images/Baldhead.JPG)

## Executive Summary

Real Estate has made more millionaires than any other industry. However, it is not accessible to everyone. This is why we built a decentralized application to tokenize and invest in real estate. 
Decentralization provides more investment opportunities to more people at a lower cost. As blockchain is rapidly spreading across industries, we believe decentralizing real estate is both valuable for long term decentralization. 
Being one of the biggest industries in the world, we are confident that creating a DApp for real estate would be a great investment long term. 

* Through our decentralized REIT, people can buy shares of real estate, to take advantage of its appreciation during periods of high inflation.
* By utilizing smart contracts, we look to simplify ownership disputes across an immutable blockchain ledger.
* Smart contracts will also alleviate transaction and legal fees that are notorious in the real estate industry.
